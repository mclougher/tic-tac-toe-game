Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Implementation

The positions on the board are represented as such: 

1 2 3|
4 5 6|
7 8 9

In addition, by changing the value of variable "sizeOfBoard" in main, the game can be run on an nxn square.  For example, if sizeOfBoard=4, then the positions on the game board would look like this:

1   2  3  4
5   6  7  8
9  10 11 12
13 14 15 16
